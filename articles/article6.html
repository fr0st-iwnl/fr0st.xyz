            <div class="article-content">
                <p>If you really enjoy listening to music like I do all the time or just like having your favorite songs ready, 
                I wanted to share the apps I actually use, what I like about them, and what I don't. <!----Most of the tips and setups here are for <b>Android</b>, <b>Windows</b>, <b>macOS</b>, and <b>Linux</b>.-----></p>
				<h2>#1. <i class="fa-brands fa-spotify brands-icon"></i> Spotify</h2>
				<br>
				<p><b>Spotify</b> has a great UI and is pretty lightweight as a music app, in my opinion. It's great for playlists, popular music, and keeping all my liked songs in one place.
                    But it does have downsides like ads and premium-only features. 
                    In the past, you could patch Spotify with apps like <a href="https://github.com/Team-xManager/xManager" target="_blank">XManager</a> or <a href="https://revanced.app/" target="_blank">ReVanced</a> to remove ads. <b>(They're basically apps that patch other apps to unlock some features.)</b>
                    XManager patches still exist but don't work anymore, and I think XManager has the same problem as ReVanced, where songs sometimes skip to another track when you try to play them.</p>
                <p>I still use Spotify on both <b>PC</b> and <b>Phone</b> because I have tons of liked songs and playlists. 
                I've even transferred some playlists to <b>YouTube Music</b>, but I still have a huge library on Spotify, so switching fully isn't an option right now.</p>
				
                <div class="terminal-feature-list">
                    <p class="feature-intro"><em>HOW I USE IT:</em></p>
                    
                    <p><b>PC:</b> I use <a href="https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX" target="_blank">SpotX (Windows)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SpotX-Official/SpotX-Bash" target="_blank">SpotX-Bash (MacOS / Linux)</a>, which let me use Spotify without ads on my Windows and Linux machines.
					Alternatively, you could also use <a href="https://spicetify.app/" target="_blank">Spicetify</a>.
					</p>
                    <p><b>Phone:</b> I use Spotify in the <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave browser</a>. 
                        Brave has a built-in ad blocker, and if you enable <b>"Desktop Site"</b> in the browser menu,
						it lets you listen to Spotify songs without ads. The UI can be tricky on mobile when using the desktop site setting,
						but it's still manageable. I'll also upload a pic showing how to enable it.

						<div class="glightbox-wrapper">
						<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/k5yyNWzv/desktop-site.png" class="glightbox" data-gallery="gallery1">
							<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k5yyNWzv/desktop-site.png" width="200">
						</a>
						</div>
						<br>
						Oh and also, if you're struggling to change songs in the browser UI, 
						you can just use your <b>phone's media controls</b> (the little player that shows up in the notification/lock screen). 
						It's way easier than dealing with the web browser controls. I'll upload a pic so you can see more clearly.
						
						<div class="glightbox-wrapper">
						<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/66dJf801/phone-media-controls.png" class="glightbox" data-gallery="gallery1">
							<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66dJf801/phone-media-controls.png" width="300">
						</a>
						</div>

                    
                    <h3>Downsides:</h3>
                    <p>Free version has ads</p>
                    <p>Premium costs money</p>
                    <p>Free version has limited skips: you're allowed up to six per hour.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Even with the downsides, <b>Spotify</b> is my daily music app because all of my songs are already there. 
                I've also seen people say that version <b>"9.0.46.496"</b> of <b>Spotify</b> can be patched with <b>ReVanced</b> or <b>XManager</b>, but I've only tried it once with ReVanced patches and it didn't work. 
                Maybe I was doing something wrong, or maybe it only works with XManager. 
                If you know how to get it working and want to share, you can <a href="mailto:fr0st.xyz@tuta.io" target="_blank">Email me</a> or DM me on <a href="https://frostiwnl.netlify.app/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>#2. <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-play brands-icon"></i> YouTube Music</h2>
				<br>

                <p><b>YouTube Music's</b> UI isn't perfect, and in my opinion, it's a bit heavier than Spotify, but I like it because I can patch it with <a href="https://revanced.app/" target="_blank">ReVanced</a> to remove ads.
                It also lets you watch the music video when available, which is a nice extra feature.</p>
				
                <div class="terminal-feature-list">
                    <p class="feature-intro"><em>HOW I USE IT:</em></p>
                    
                    <p><b>PC:</b> I use an open-source desktop app for <a href="https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a> which supports plugins like Discord Rich Presence, ad blocking, and many others.</p>
                    <p><b>Phone:</b> I use the patched app with <a href="https://revanced.app/" target="_blank">ReVanced</a>. You could also try it on Brave, but I stick with the patched version for now.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Downsides:</h3>
                    <p>Free version has ads</p>
                    <p>Premium costs money</p>
                    <p>Sometimes you need to provide your own <b>ID</b> to play a song because YouTube Music thinks the content is restricted (mature, etc.), which is crazy in my opinion. This is <b>server-side</b>, so no patch or bypass exists for ReVanced, see issue <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/5453" target="_blank">#5453</a>)</p>
                </div>

                <p>So yeah, I usually turn to YouTube Music if something stops working on Spotify.</p>


                <h2>#3. <i class="fa-brands fa-soundcloud brands-icon"></i> SoundCloud</h2>
				<br>

                <p><b>SoundCloud</b> was actually the first music app I used. It's free and has tons of music content. 
                Some songs might not be available in your country, but usually you can find another version uploaded by someone else.
                I've heard some people get ads on the free version depending on their region, but I've never had ads in my entire time using SoundCloud.
                </p>
				
                <div class="terminal-feature-list">
                    <p class="feature-intro"><em>HOW I USE IT:</em></p>
                    
                    <p><b>PC:</b> I mainly use the browser version.</p>
                    <p><b>Phone:</b> I use the SoundCloud app. I think you can also patch it with <a href="https://revanced.app/" target="_blank">ReVanced</a> to remove ads, but I've never tried it myself.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Downsides:</h3>
                    <p>Free version may have ads, depending on your region</p>
                    <p>Premium costs money</p>
                    <p>Some tracks might be restricted in your country</p>
                </div>

                <p>I still enjoy SoundCloud, though some songs aren't available in my country.</p>

                <h2>ï¼  Final Thoughts</h2>
                <br> 
                <p><b>Spotify</b> is my main app for <b>daily listening</b>. Ads and country restrictions are annoying, but all my music is already there.
                <b>YouTube Music</b> is a great backup, especially patched with <a href="https://revanced.app/" target="_blank">ReVanced</a> or used on <b>PC</b>, and it's nice to have the video feature.
                But of course, YouTube could change things in the future and make it unpatchable. 
                If that ever happened, I think I'd end up going with <b>SoundCloud</b> in the end. <b>SoundCloud</b> is perfect for free music and discovering new artists, but yeah, like I said, some songs may be unavailable depending on your location. 
                <p>That's how I manage my music between <b>PC</b> and <b>phone</b>. It might not be perfect, but it keeps me listening to the songs I like.</p>
