            <div class="article-content">
                <p>I couldn't find any lightweight automation tools for keybindings at all, plus I wanted one that was open source, so I decided to create my own. Since I already liked <b>automation</b> and knew <b>Autohotkey</b>, I had some macros I made in the past, but they were hard to customize and not great. So, I decided to create a simpler script for everyone.</p>
                <p>I started with AHK v2 instead of v1 because I wanted to try something new and build a tool for custom keybindings. I also wanted something similar to the keybinding system I had on Hyprland in Linux, where I could easily assign keys to different functions. It was tricky at first since I wasn't familiar with v2, but after a week of work, I finally got it right, and I'm happy with the result.
                </p>
				<h2>#1 Why I Recommend WinMacros</h2>
				<br>
				<p>First of all, it's incredibly easy to use. If you've ever struggled with creating or managing macros, you'll appreciate how simple this script is to set up and use. The script starts with the Welcome Screen by default, but you can also open it anytime by pressing <b>Ctrl + Alt + M</b>. From there, everything's in one place.
					Want to set custom shortcuts for apps like your <em>Browser, File Explorer, PowerShell, or VSCode</em>? Just go to <b>"Hotkey Settings"</b> and pick what you want.
					I also made sure it's easy to change things. You can tweak the script however you like to fit your setup.</p>
                <p>If that's not enough, the script also includes a <b>"Launcher Settings"</b> feature where you can add your own <b>.exe</b> files and assign them to any key you want. You can even give each one a custom name that shows up in the notification when it's launched. There's also a <b>"Power Menu" (Alt + Backspace)</b> that allows you to quickly <b>Shut Down, Restart, Sleep, or Log Off</b> your computer.</p>
				
                <div class="terminal-feature-list">
                    <p class="feature-intro"><em>WinMacros</em> also includes a set of useful options under the <b>General Settings</b> section in the GUI:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Switch between Light and Dark themes</p>
                    
                    <h3>Startup Options</h3>
                    <p>Choose whether to show the Welcome Screen at startup</p>
                    <p>Set WinMacros to launch when Windows starts</p>
                    
                    <h3>Notifications</h3>
                    <p>Turn notifications ON or OFF as you prefer</p>
                    
                    <h3>Configuration</h3>
                    <p>And of course, the best part you can easily Import and Export all your custom Hotkeys and Launchers</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>It's lightweight, so it won't slow down your system like other heavy automation tools it uses only <b>5.5 MB</b> of memory <em><b>Crazy, right? :)</b></em>. Whether you want to speed up your tasks or organize your system, this script can help. You can control sound settings, open apps, toggle system tools, and manage your power options easily.</p>
                  <br>
                <h2>#2 Speed Up Your Workflow</h2>
				<br>
				<p>This script saves you time. No more searching through menus or clicking to open apps or change settings. Just set up your keybindings once, and everything you need will be right at your fingertips, making your tasks quicker.</p>
				<br>
                <p>I also created a user-friendly website for the tool, where you can easily see how it works and explore its features. It's clean, simple, and showcases all the capabilities of the script, so you can quickly get started. Check out the <a href="https://winmacros.netlify.app/" target="_blank">website</a> to see the <a href="https://winmacros.netlify.app/#showcase" target="_blank">full showcase</a> of what the tool can do!</p>
                <br>
                <h2>＠ Final Thoughts</h2>
                <br> 
                <p>If you need an easy way to set up keybindings and automate tasks, this script is perfect for you. It's light, flexible, and gives you full control over your system without being complicated. Whether you want to work faster, organize your setup, or create custom shortcuts, this script does it all. Try it out and see how much time you can save!</p>
